use git init, to initialize git repository.

use git status,to know the status of the repository.

use git add <file> ,to add the file to staging area, 
    git add . , to add  both files and folders (directories) to the staging area.

    Non-empty folders: If a folder contains at least one file, using git add . will add the folder along with its files to the staging area.

    Empty folders: Git doesn't track empty folders, so if a folder is empty, it won't be added to the staging area, even if you use git add .....

use git restore <file> , will provide u back the original file with discarded changes

use git rm --cached <file>, is use to return the file from staging area to changes section.

Next step is to push local repo(my device) to remote repo(github)

create repo in github
git remote add origin <remote repo address>
git remote -v , to check connection made or not
git branch -M main, to convert the default master branch to main branch
git push -u origin main,to push the local repo to remote,(write only once for rest of time to push just write git push)
